# Changelog

## v4.0.1-dev

* Enhancements
  * [#331](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/331) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * Allow `do end` blocks to fold to `do: ...`
    * Allow `->` operator and the right operand to fold to `-> ...`
    * Allow `@doc`, `@moduledoc` and `@typedoc` value to fold to `"..."`.
    * Fold runs of adjacent `alias`, `import`, `require`, or `use` to be followed to a single `alias`, `import`, `require`, or `use` followed by `...`. 
  * [#334](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/334) - Function separators - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * Show a function separator (Preferences > Editor > General > Appearance > Show method separators) above the group of `@doc`, `@spec` and `def`, `defp`, `defmacro`, and `defmacrop` (call definition clauses) of the same name and arity range.  Arity range will be used if one of the call definition clauses uses default arguments.
  
* Bug Fixes
  * [#330](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/330) - Check if `parameter` is `null` before `Variable#execute` call in `Variable#execute(PsiElement[], ResolveState)`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

## v4.0.0
* Enhancements
  * [#314](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/314) - Call references for unqualified no argument calls that work as variables or parameters - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * Resolve and highlight parameter references
      * Resolve call definition clause (`def(macro)?p?`) parameters to themselves
      * Resolve call definition parameter with default to itself
      * Add Parameter ot Color Settings Page
      * Parameters in any macro with do block or keyword pair
    * Resolve and highlight variable references
      * Properly identifier variable declared in `for` comprehension as variable
      * Add Variable to Color Settings Page
      * Highlight bind quoted keyword key as Variable
      * Resolve references to earlier `&&` operands, which handles code that matches a variable and only uses the variable on success like [`((cwd = cwd()) && write_tmp_dir(cwd))`](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/ccf6d14e3ec2eb96090222dad6f395b5b9ab72ac/lib/elixir/lib/system.ex#L268)
      * Resolve variables from `destructure`
    * Detect bitstring segment options and don't treat them as variables.
      * Highlight bitstring segment type options as Type, the same highlight as used for `@type` names.
      * Don't generate (unresolved) references for bitstring segment options
    * Resolve `_` to only itself, no matter how many are used to reflect that it is non-binding, while `_<name>`  will resolve to `_<name>` as it does bind.
      * Add Ignored Variable to Color Settings Page
    * Reimplement module attribute renaming so that variable renaming can be implemented using a different validator for renaming (since module attribute names include the `@`).  Non-inplace renaming should also be supported, but inplace is preferred.  (There's a setting to turn off in-place renaming in JetBrains IDEs.)
    * `operation.infix.Normalized`
      * Normalizes leftOperand, operator, and rightOperand for an Infix operation that may have errors (in either operand).  If there is an error in the operand then its normalized value is `null`.
    * Keyword key type descriptions
      * Default to `"keyword key"`. 
      * Detect `bind_quoted:` usage and call those `"quote bound variable"`.
    * Add interfaces to unify matching of `Matched` and `Unmatched` form of operations when the code cares about the operator
      * `And`
      * `UnaryNonNumericOperation`
    * Add `processDeclarations` to support variable and parameter resolution using `PsiTreeUtil.treeWalkUp` and `PsiScopeProcessors`
      * `ElixirStabBody`
      * StabOperations
    * Treat variables and parameters as `NamedElements`, so they can be Rename Refactored.
    * Move reused Module and Function names to `org.elixir_lang.psi.name.{Module,Function}` constants.
    * Parameter and Variable completion  
  * [#318](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/318) - Highlight keyword keys (`key:` in `key: value`) that aren't quotes (`"key": value` or `'key': value`) as Atom. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * [#320](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/320) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

        * `Parentheses` (`(` and `)`)
        * `Semicolon` (`;`)
      * `Calls`

    * Update Preferences > Editor > Colors & Fonts > Elixir example text's bitstring syntax to Elixir post-1.0.0 (Use `-` to separate segment options instead of a list.)
    * Use same algorithm for `ElixirStabBody` and `ElixirFile` because they are sequences of expressions.
    * Highlight atom keywords (`false`, `nil`, and `true`) as merge of `Atom` and `Keyword` text attributes.  If both only use foreground color, `Keyword` wins.
    * Annotate `QualifiableAlias` as `Alias`.
    * Highlight keyword list and map keywords (`<key>:`) as `Atom`.
    * Add `with` to highlighted special forms  
  * [#322](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/322) - Additional Text Attributes - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * Default text attributes for "Darcula" and "Default" themes: almost every Text Attribute Key has a unique hue for the Foreground color.
    * Explain how to add `additionalTextAttributes` to `plugin.xml` in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
    * Group Textual Text Attribute Keys Together: Next "Textual" group is created and "Character List", "Escape Sequence", "Sigil", and "String" are moved under the group.
    * Describe relations between different text attributes in `COLOR_SCHEMA_DESIGN.xml`, so they can be applied to different base schemes, such as applying the current Darcula additonalTextAttributes to Default.
* Bug Fixes
  * [#314](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/314) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * Don't generate module attribute references for control attributes: Module attributes that control compilation or are predefined by the standard library: `@behaviour`, `@callback`, `@macrocallback`, `@doc`, `@moduledoc`, `@typedoc`, `@spec`, `@opaque`, `@type`, and `@typep`, should not have references because their uses are unrelated.
    * Drop requirement that there are 2 children and only require there be 1 and assume that is the Operator.
    * Don't count @(...) as a module attribute usage: Module attribute declarations are defined as `defmacro @(...)` in Kernel and that `@` should count as a function name, not a prefix for a module attribute name.
    * Allow `null` Module for Scratch File use scope
    * Default to `"call"` for Call type
    * Fix typo that had `*Two` operations using `Type` interface
    * Don't process `AccessExpression` declarations
  * [#316](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/316) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * Highlight `foo` in `@spec foo` as a type, which occurs while typing a new `@spec` before `::` can be typed.
    * Check if `leftOperand` is `null` even when `checkLeft` is `true` because `checkLeft` can be `true` and `leftOperand` is `null` when the `lastParent` is the operand or operation as a whole, but there is an error in the unnormalized `leftOperand` leading to the normalized `leftOperand` being `null`.
    * Check if reference is `null` before checking if it resolves to `null` when replacing module attribute usages with their value because `AtNonNumericOperation`s can have a `null` reference when they are non-referencing, like `@spec`.
  * [#317](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/317) - Leave normal highlighting for char tokens when highlighting types - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * [#320](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/320) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * Stab operation parameter Use Scope is the stab operation.
    * Skip over `PsiLeafElement` when looking for variables because the `PsiLeafElement` is an error.
    * In a script file where the parent of a `Match` is a `PsiFile`, the `Match` Use Scope is the rest of the file.
    * Add `=` to `Operator Signs`
    * Skip `NoParenthesesKeywords` when highlighting types, which occurs when the `::` has no proper right operand and the following one-liner function clause with `do:` is parsed as the right operand.
    * Skip `DUMMY_BLOCK` when looking for Variable, which prevents walking through errors.
    * Use `Normalized` pattern for `Prefix`, so that the operand is `null` when only the operator matches or the operand has errors.
    * Work-around Phoenix .ex templates that contain EEX: if `<%=` from EEX is detected, don't throw error when `Modular` can't be found.
    * Fix capitalization error in example text
  * [#323](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/323) - Build `jps-builder` using only Java 1.6 compatible `.class`es - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * In IntelliJ 14.1, all of `openapi.jar` targets Java 1.6 (with `MAJOR.MINOR` `50.0`), but in IntelliJ 2016.1, some of `openapi.jar` targets only Java 1.8 (with `MAJOR.MINOR` `52.0`), since `jps-builders` require parts of `openapi.jar` and must target Java 1.6 even for IntelliJ 2016.1, the `52.0` `.class`es needed to be ported into `org.elixir_lang.jps.builder`, so that the `52.0` version in `openapi.jar` wouldn't be attempted to be loaded.
      
      This ended up being 5 classes:
    
      * `ExecutionException`
      * `GeneralCommandLine`
      * `ParametersList`
      * `ParamsGroup`
      * `ProcessNotCreatedException`
    
      Only `GeneralCommandLine` was used directly, all others are dependencies of it.
* Incompatible Changes
  * [#320](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/320) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * Preferences > Editor > Colors & Fonts > Elixir restructured to group together related highlights and to match grouping used for Colors & Fonts > Language Defaults and Colors & Fonts > Java.
      * `Documentation Module Attributes` renamed to `Module Attributes` > `Documentation`
      * `Documentation Text` renamed to `Module Attributes > Documentation > Text`
      * `Expression Substitution Mark` renamed to `Braces and Operators > Interpolation`.
      * The following are now nested under `Numbers` instead of being at the top-level:
        * `Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal, and Octal Digits`
        * `Decimal Exponent, Mark and Separator` 
        * `Invalid Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal, and Octal Digits`
        * `Non-Decimal Base Prefix`
        * `Obsolete Non-Decimal Base Prefix`
  * [#322](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/322) - "Character List", "Escape Sequence", "Sigil", and "String" are moved under the new "Textual" group. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * [#324](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/324) - Group Numbers subcategories and lower display name verbosity - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * "Numbers > Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal, and Octal Digits" renamed to "Numbers > Digits > Valid"
    * "Numbers > Invalid Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal, and Octal Digits" renamed to "Numbers > Digits > Invalid"
    * "Numbers > Non-Decimal Base Prefix" renamed to "Numbers > Base Prefix > Non-Decimal"
    * "Numbers > Obsolete Non-Decimal Base" renamed to "Numbers > Base Prefix > Obsolete > Non-Decimal"
## v3.0.1
* Bug Fixes
  * [#287](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/287) - Use the error reporter logger instead of plain `assert` in `Prefix#operator`.  **NOTE: This does not address error recovery recovery since I don't have a regression test case.** - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * [#283](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/283) - All function name elements act as `PsiNameIdentifier`s now even if they don't resolve, but that means they all need to support `FindUsagesProvider#getType`, which they don't, so use a placeholder of "unknown call type" for any `Call` that can't be matched and "unknown element" for anything else. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * [#284](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/284) - Enumerate all Kernel Functions, Macros, and Special Forms in the Syntax Highlighting section of the README, so that users searching for which category controls highlighting a given call can find it. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  
## v3.0.0
* Enhancements
  * [#257](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/257) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * Go To Symbol (âŒ¥âŒ˜O)
      * Call definition clauses (`def`, `defp`, `defmacro`, and `defmacrop`)
      * Callbacks (`@callback` and `@macrocallback`)
      * Call definition specifications (`@spec`)
      * Call definition heads (`foo(bar)`) for delegation (`defdelegate foo(bar), to: BAZ`)
      * Implementations (`defimpl`)
      * Protocols (`defprotocol`)
    * Go To Declaration for Aliases now uses the same `isModular` checks as the stubbing for the index uses for Go To Symbol.
  * [#263](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/263) - Build against 14.0, 14.1, 15.0, and 2016.1 on travis-ci to ensure continued compatibility. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * [#273](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/273) - Error reporting for type highlighter gives the Class, Excerpt and Full Text when an unknown element type is encountered as the Excerpt alone is not enough sometimes. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * [#275](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/275) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * Custom error handling that will open an issue against https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir with the exception messsage and stacktrace filled in.
    * Changed `NotImplementedExceptions` and (some) `assert`s to logging custom error message that include the `PsiElement` text and the containing file as an attachment.  The files make the URL too big for the error handler to put the file contents in when opening the browser with the error handler, so the issue body instead explains how to get the attachment text out of IntelliJ's "IDE Fatal Errors"
  * [#276](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/276) - Update to Grammar Kit 1.3.0. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* Bug Fixes
  * [#256](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/256) - Fix Elixir Mix Run configuration not persisting past restart - [@zyuyou](https://github.com/zyuyou)
  * [#259](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/259) - Allow `Infix#operator` to work on operations with errors, which eliminates the `AssertionError` reported when typing infix operation and they are incomplete - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * [#259](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/260) - Add Keywords to the Preferences > Editor > Colors & Fonts > Elixir settings page, so it can be customized for just Elixir instead of having to change Preferences > Editor > Colors & Fonts > General > Keyword - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * [#263](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/263) - Ensure compatibility from 14.0 to 2016.1 - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * Use `TextAttributesKey`s that aren't deprecated in 2016.1 and work back to 14.1
         
      All of `CodeInsightColors` is deprecated, so all constants from there had to be replaced.  Unfortunately, the recommended replacements don't have the same color as the original, so I used different `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors` constants for some.
    
      "Module Attribute" is now based on `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors.CONSTANT` (which is purplish in Darcula) instead of the recommended `METADATA`, which is yellow.  Although module attributes don't have to be constant since they can be set to accumulate, often they are used as constants and not really as metadata, since they are just data then.  All the `metadata` uses of module attributes have a separate color.
    
      "Specification" is now based on `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors.FUNCTION_DECLARATION`, which maintains the golden color that `CodeInsightColors.METHOD_DECLARATION_ATTRIBUTES` had.
    
      "Type" is now based on `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors.METADATA`, which is bright yellow unlike `CodeInsightColors.ANNOTATION_ATTRIBUTE_NAME_ATTRIBUTES`, which was a bright white.
    
      "Type Parameter" is now based on `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors.PARAMETER`, which unfortunately has no attributes associated with it, but the constant name was too good a fit not to use, so if you want the old color, you'll need to customize it yourself.
    * Restore compatibility with the IntelliJ IDEA 14.0 release line
      * By using reflection to call `FileTemplateManager#getInstance` if `FileTemplateManager#getDefaultInstance` is not available
      * By calling `FileChooserDescriptorFactory#createSingleLocalFileDescriptor` (which works in 14.0 through 2016.1) instead of `FileChooserDescriptorFactory#createSingleFileDescriptor` (which only works in 14.1 through 2016.1)
  * [#264](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/264) - Use more human-readable error message for Elixir File action - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * Instead of showing the regular expression pattern, which may be confusing to new developers, explain in English the expected pattern. I also included the description, which explains how nesting is mapped to directories, of the action since it doesn't actually show up in the dialog otherwise.
  * [#265](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/265) - Check if a file exists before allowing Elixir Module to be created. If it exists, show an error with the conflicting path. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * [#272](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/272) - Fix (one cause) of `AssertionError` in `GoToSymbolContributor` when the `Modular` (`defimpl`, `demodule`, `defprotocol`, and `quote`) could not be resolved due a `def` being surrounded by a `for` comprehension, which is common in Elixir libraries as was the case for `Postgrex`: any enclosing `for` comprehension(s) will now be ignored and the next enclosing macro will be checked to see if it is a `Modular`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * [#273](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/273) - While typing, before `:` in keyword pairs, after the `when`, such as in `@spec foo(id) :: id when id` before finishing typing `@spec foo(id) :: id when id: String.t`, the keyword key will be properly highlighted as a Type Parameter - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * [#276](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/276) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * Properly handle the `Infix#rightOperand` being `null` due to the Pratt Parser matching up through the operator and then ignoring the mismatched right operand, which leads to the `Infix` having only 2 elements: the left operand and the operator.
    * `@doc` and other module attributes appearing as the right operand of `@type name ::` will be ignored as it is common when adding a new type above pre-existing, documented functions.
    * Only error in `Infix#leftOperand` if there are not 2-3 children for `Infix` instead of a strict 3.
* Incompatible Changes
  * [#276](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/276) - Drop support for IntelliJ 14.0 because the parser generated by Grammar Kit 1.3.0 is not compatible with the OpenAPI libraries shipped in IntelliJ 14.0.  Still compatible with 14.1 through 2016.1. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
